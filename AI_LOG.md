## Scaffold: Bun + Vite
- Prompt: Switch the JavaScript runtime/package manager to Bun and set up the basic Vite app scaffold for LAST LIFT.
- Tool: Codex with PowerShell and `apply_patch`.
- Result: Added a strict TypeScript, Vite 7, Phaser 3.90 starter with Boot, Title, Room, and End scenes; updated project instructions to use Bun.
- Mistake caught: My first package manifest draft omitted the Bun toolchain declaration. I caught it while reviewing the package setup and added `packageManager: bun@1.4.0` before installing dependencies.
